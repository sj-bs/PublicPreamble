## Usage

You'll need to change the file paths for the various ``` \usepackage{}```'s in ```preamble.sty```

### Preamble options:
- Colour: On / Off
- Font: Roman / Sans
- Style: Handout / Notes
- Margin: Normal / Thin
- Appendix: On / Off (make sure you remove the ```\SSappendix``` if you're turning it off otherwise it'll throw errors)

That's about it really. 

## To do 

* Add the Coffee theme back because it's winter and summer colours are out (Yes, I colour my preamble on the seasons)
* Make the Black theme nicer
* Actually add documentation 
* Create a real usage guide
