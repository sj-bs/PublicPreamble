## Usage

You'll need to change the file paths for the various ``` \usepackage{}```'s in ```preamble.sty```. 
Also if you're turning appendix off, make sure you remove the ```\SSappendix``` otherwise it'll throw errors. That's about it really. 


## To do 

* Add the Coffee theme back because it's winter and summer colours are out (Yes, I colour my preamble on the seasons)
* Make the Black theme nicer
* Actually add documentation 
* Create a real usage guide
