\section{Acknowledgements}

Thanks to Evan for creating the original stylesheet which I have since modified extensively to suit my needs and preferences. You can find the original preamble file \href{https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/master/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty}{here}, and my rewritten version \href{https://github.com/sj-bs/Summer2020/blob/master/Handout/Preamble.sty}{here}.\bigskip

Finally, I used an extract of Dexta Chua's Cambridge lecture notes as the basis to showcase the preamble. Note that since I did just copy and paste their TeX with minimal modification, the product may be suboptimal in parts.
